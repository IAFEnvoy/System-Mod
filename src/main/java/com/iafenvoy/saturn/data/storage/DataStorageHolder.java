/**
 * The state one module keeps for the content its host holds, addressed by whatever names one definition and the
 * kind's class (the host is the attachment or component this lives in). One pair addresses exactly one value, so a
 * second value of a kind already there replaces it instead of joining it. Values are mutable and are stored as the
 * kind instance itself, so the holder hands back exactly what was written and never has to know any module's shape.
 * Nothing here reaches the host that carries it: each value records its own change, and whoever wants to save and
 * sync reads that.
 *
 * <p>The type parameter is the address, not a definition type: a holder of abilities is a
 * {@code DataStorageHolder<Holder<Ability>>} and takes {@code Holder<Ability>} keys, while a host whose definitions
 * are named some other way - a {@code ResourceKey}, a {@code UUID}, a name of its own - parameterises this class with
 * that and is served just the same. Saving is not a requirement of using it: a host that never persists a holder
 * simply never asks for a {@link #codec(Codec)}, which is also the answer for an address no codec can write.
 *
 * <p>The address is the definition's identity, so a saved value whose definition left the pack is dropped on load
 * (one logged line) rather than kept under an id nothing can ask for again.
