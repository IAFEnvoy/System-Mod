/**
 * The execution skeleton every bound fee shares. A transaction is a fixed target at a fixed amount: asked whether it
 * can be paid it writes nothing, asked to pay it writes its own channel - and the first real answer is the one it
 * keeps, so calling it twice cannot charge twice.
 *
 * <p>The amount is copied, never read back from the definition: a replacement is a new transaction with the same
 * binding, which is how a payment re-prices a fee without re-running the formula that priced it.
 *
 * <p>The re-entrancy guard lives here rather than in a payment, so a script that executes a transaction directly is
 * guarded the same way a bill is: the stores being written on this thread are one set, and a second pass over one of
 * them is refused instead of interleaved.
