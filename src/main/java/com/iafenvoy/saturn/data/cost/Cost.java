/**
 * One entry of a costs array. An entry is data and does one thing: given the context of a payment it prices itself and
 * returns the fee it would charge - a {@link Transaction}, bound to one store at one fixed amount. It does not ask any
 * store whether it can pay, does not write, and remembers nothing between calls, so "what this costs" is decided in
 * exactly one place and the payment is what decides "can this be paid" and "take it".
 *
 * <p>The fixed amount is why a dynamic formula is evaluated once per payment: everything after {@link #prepare} works
 * on the bound fee, and a payment that re-prices or scales one creates a replacement rather than re-running the
 * formula. {@link Transaction#execute} is the only channel write there is.
 *
 * <p>Repeated targets are diagnosed but never merged: both passes keep entry order. Packs should use one entry per
 * target; a real deduction failure only warns and does not cancel later fees or the business action.
